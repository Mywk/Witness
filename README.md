Home Automation System using REST for Windows 10 IOT

This project is what I use at my place to control several relays with a Raspberry PI3 running Windows 10 IOT.

Features:
- Relay control

Planned features:
- Lights control (MiLight bridge)
- YouTube Playlist
- Alarm clock
- Timed relay control
- Voice control (probably going with Cortana for this one)

Planned for later (if someone else wants to help with this project):
- Plugins (for example instead of a static MiLight bridge controller, use a plugin instead)
- Login and authentication
- Dynamic entries instead of static ones (all the entries in the HTML document are currently static values, like power sockets, etc...)


Don't expect the commits to be very detailed.
