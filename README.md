Home Automation System using REST for Windows 10 IOT

This project is what I use at my place to control several relays via a Web server with a Raspberry PI3 running Windows 10 IOT.

Features:
- Relay control

Planned features:
- Lights control (MiLight bridge)
- YouTube Playlist
- Alarm clock
- Voice control (probably going with Cortana for this one)
- Add/Remove relays in the webpage instead of statically in the code

Currently working on:
- Timed relay control

Planned for later (if someone else wants to help with this project):
- Plugins (for example instead of a static MiLight bridge controller, use a plugin instead)
- Login and authentication
- Embedded remote control for desktop (mouse, window view, cmd line, shutdown/sleep/etc..)

Don't expect the commits to be very detailed.
